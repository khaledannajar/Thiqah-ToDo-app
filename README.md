# Thiqah-ToDo-app
Interview task of Thiqah

This app uses Core data to store todo list items also it has code that itegrates with firebase database.

I use MVVM to draw the TODOs in different two views with a single view model.

We code use Firebase DB alone as it has offline setting, but this is the requirement to have both and sync between them.


The part of syncronizaiton with firebase is done in code, but it is not working yet. It needs debuging to fix some issues.
